title: Tools for the computational analysis of language and text
description: This online course was created during the pandemic and designed specifically for the set of University of Zurich students that enrolled in Autumn 2020. Besides the swirl courses, the course consists of a number of accompanying videos that introduce some of the most relevant concepts as well as the data used in the swirl lessons. You can find the videos here – as you will see, these videos were thought only for being used within that specific course. They will be renewed soon, but for now we appreciate your understanding… And we hope you get a laugh with them!
